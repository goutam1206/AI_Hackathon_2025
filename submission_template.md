# Project Title
Stocker.ai

## Overview of the Idea
The main idea of this AI Agent is to get the 360 degree view of the stocks data from local, global events, and link this data to the investors for a better option of trading.
This project gives the traders an edge of getting a one source or one place where all the data available for investement one requires.

## Project Goal
This project should provide a suggestive approach of investing / dis-investing, managing funds driven through AI. 
Not just a suggestion, AI will provide the reasons behind the suggestions, so that a human can take a decision based on the reasons for the AI suggestion.

## How It Works
There are multiple ways one can use this agent. One can follow an investment sector, a particular Mutual fund, a particular company to get this data.
An option of going through a time-period based analysis is also possible. Once can do a chat messages to get a conversational experience for the suggestive investments.
This provides a feel and real-time experience with proper justification as to why one needs to trade with the above mentioned entities.
